    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello Iâ€™m Iulian and I love to work with technology. 
        It fascinates and intrigues me. 
        I am a keen programmer with experience building multiple, self-driven projects, in Python, JavaScript, C#, C, C++, Cool, HTML, PHP, CSS and Java. 
        I enjoy the theoretical and practical sides of programming and am looking to join a team so that I may expand my horizons. 
        Despite liking programming I also enjoy various other things and if you continue looking I am certain you will see.

    <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>My journey into the world of HTML and CSS began at Queen Mary University of London, where I was first introduced to the fascinating world of web development. Through engaging lectures, hands-on workshops, and dedicated self-study, I grasped the fundamentals of structuring content with HTML and styling it with CSS. This solid foundation, coupled with practical projects assigned by my professors, allowed me to build a portfolio of projects, ranging from personal websites to simple web applications. The experience at Queen Mary University of London not only solidified my understanding of web development principles but also equipped me with the skills to bring my creative ideas to life online.</p>

    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>Python has been a constant companion since my GCSE days. I've used it for a wide range of projects, from automating tasks to building command-line interfaces (CLIs). One of my favorite projects involved creating a CLI that extended the functionality of the terminal by adding custom commands. I've also delved into data analysis using the powerful Pandas library, which has opened up new possibilities for exploring and manipulating data. Python's versatility and ease of use have made it a valuable tool for me, allowing me to tackle diverse challenges and bring my ideas to life.</p>

    <h2>SQL</h2>
    <p>My university studies introduced me to SQL, a language that empowers me to interact with databases. It opened my eyes to the world of structured data and how to effectively retrieve and manage it. I learned how to write queries to extract specific information, filter data based on various criteria, and even manipulate data to create new insights. Understanding database normalization was particularly enlightening. It taught me the importance of organizing data in a structured and efficient way, minimizing redundancy and ensuring data consistency.</p>
