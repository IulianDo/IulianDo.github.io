        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>My journey into the world of HTML and CSS began at Queen Mary University of London, where I was first introduced to the fascinating world of web development. Through engaging lectures, hands-on workshops, and dedicated self-study, I grasped the fundamentals of structuring content with HTML and styling it with CSS. This solid foundation, coupled with practical projects assigned by my professors, allowed me to build a portfolio of projects, ranging from personal websites to simple web applications. The experience at Queen Mary University of London not only solidified my understanding of web development principles but also equipped me with the skills to bring my creative ideas to life online.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>My journey with JavaScript began during high school, where I first explored the basics through Khan Academy. This online platform introduced me to variables, data types, and functions, laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors. Later, I continued to expand my skills at Ada, delving deeper into concepts like control flow and object-oriented programming. These experiences prepared me for my studies at Queen Mary University of London, where I further honed my JavaScript abilities, learning to create dynamic and engaging web applications.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>My journey with Java began at university, where I truly grasped the power of object-oriented programming. Through lectures and hands-on projects, I delved into concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, understanding how these principles enable the creation of robust and modular software. Java's emphasis on object-oriented design became a cornerstone of my programming knowledge, equipping me with the skills to develop complex applications.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Unity and C#</h3>
        <p>My passion for games led me to the world of C# and Unity. I wanted to bring my creative visions to life, and C# became the language that empowered me to do so.  I dove into the intricacies of Unity, learning how to use C# to script game logic, create interactive elements, and build compelling gameplay experiences.  C# became another tool in my arsenal for game development, allowing me to combine my love for games with the technical skills necessary to bring them to life. </p>

        <h3>Unreal Engine</h3>
        <p>My journey into game development continues with Unreal Engine. It's a powerful platform with a vast array of features that I'm still exploring.  I'm eager to learn how to leverage its capabilities to create immersive and visually stunning games.  Unreal Engine represents a new challenge and opportunity for me to expand my skillset and push the boundaries of my creativity in the world of game development.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python has been a constant companion since my GCSE days. I've used it for a wide range of projects, from automating tasks to building command-line interfaces (CLIs). One of my favorite projects involved creating a CLI that extended the functionality of the terminal by adding custom commands. I've also delved into data analysis using the powerful Pandas library, which has opened up new possibilities for exploring and manipulating data. Python's versatility and ease of use have made it a valuable tool for me, allowing me to tackle diverse challenges and bring my ideas to life.</p>

        <h3>SQL</h3>
        <p>My university studies introduced me to SQL, a language that empowers me to interact with databases. It opened my eyes to the world of structured data and how to effectively retrieve and manage it. I learned how to write queries to extract specific information, filter data based on various criteria, and even manipulate data to create new insights. Understanding database normalization was particularly enlightening. It taught me the importance of organizing data in a structured and efficient way, minimizing redundancy and ensuring data consistency.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>What is Itch.io</h3>   
        <p>Itch.io is a website dedicated to indie game developers. It serves as a platform for publishing games, hosting game jams, sharing assets, and playing games. I maintain a page there showcasing several of my creations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>My Creations</h3>   
        <p>My game development journey has involved several passion projects, each created with a specific learning goal in mind. For example, Soul Scale was developed during a game jam where i had to learn skeletal mesh creation and physics implementation. Please note that some games on my page are no longer available for download, as I've chosen to remove them. However, most of my games were developed for game jams, indicated by a "Submission to GMTK Game Jam" label in the top right corner of each game page. This label highlights the time-constrained and rule-based nature of these projects.</p>
